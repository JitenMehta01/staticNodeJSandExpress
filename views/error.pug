But if you look closely, you can usually find some valuable info here. Each line contains a file path and a line number. Most of these lines will likely reference source, library or framework files that you didn't write. But if you look closely at the end of each line, you'll likely find one or more files that you created. That file and line are usually a good place to start looking for the current bug that's causing this error.`
