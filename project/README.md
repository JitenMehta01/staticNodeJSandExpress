Going for Exceeds!!

- Running npm start should start the app

- page-not-found pug file renders if there is a 404 status error. The error pug loads if anything other than satus 404 occurs

- I have changed and added css properties to the following:
    - Sidebar
    - Wrapper Div
    - Buttons
    - Hover on Buttons
    - Some h1 / h2 / h5 tags

- I decided to use fillter text as i already have a portfolio websiter from the FEWD Techdegree
